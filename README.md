Before run the answer.py file you will need to run analyse.py file which is found on the internet.

Run this command before running the Answer.py file.
   python3 analyse.py --inputpcap /path/to/pcap --striptxt /path/to/folder

After you run answer.py you will have to input n_garms and X value.

Voila!!! You will get the Maliciousness and the text based on the value of X.
